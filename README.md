## Application Details

The Vacation Budget Tracker application is designed to help users look at vacation expenses for particular destinations from particular departure cities. Users are required to enter the travel date as well, as this will help users compare expenses for partciular vacations during a certain time of the year.

The Vacation Budget Tracker currently offers basic features but looks forward to implementing newer features for future editions. Currently a user is allowed ro sign-up to the application, where users are allowed to create a vacation once they are logged in. In creating a new vacation, users are required to enter a vacation 'description', 'date', 'departure location', 'destination', 'budget', and 'spending'. Based on the information provided, the application will calculate if there was deficit or a saving based on the amount budgeted by the user and the actual amount of spending for the vacation. The amount saved or in deficited is calculated and shown.

Users are allowed to view all vacations created by other users as the application shows public information for users to plan vacations and budget. The feature is available once a user is logged in. A user is also allowed to unter the id number of a particular vacation to view that vacation details. Users are allowed to edit and delete a vacation created by themselves, and not of other users. Currently, a user cannot view all of the vacations created only by themselves in a single page rather can view all of the vacations created by all of the users in a single page. The feauture will be implemented in a future editions of the application.
